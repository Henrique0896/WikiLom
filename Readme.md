### Configuration

First of all, you need to create a virtual environment for your project. You can achieve this by using the following command:
```shell
# Install these packages, case you don't already have it.
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install virtualenv 

# Create the Virtual Environment
virtualenv env
```

We still need to activate the virtual environment, we can do this by issuing the following command to the system.
```shell
source env/bin/activate
```

Now that the environment is ready, we can install the project required packages.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you need to install MongoDB Server in your machine. You can do this by using:
```shell
sudo apt install -y mongodb
```
Check the installation by:
```shell
sudo systemctl status mongodb
```


### Running the project
Now that we have the project properly configured, you can start the server with:
```shell
python run.py
```
